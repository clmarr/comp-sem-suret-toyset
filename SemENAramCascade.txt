$Deriving Eastern Neo-Aramaic from Proto-Semitic per second takehome problem in Comparative Semitic that I totes went crazy with. 

$ affricates ts and s become fricatives (development shared with Hebrew). Can just use +delrel (delayed release) to target them as they are the only affricates, I believe. 
[+delrel] > [+cont]

$ final ʔ effaced. (shared with Hebrew?) 
ʔ > ∅ / __ #

$ final -m is effaced (shared with Hebrew?)
m > ∅ / __ # 

$ Beghadhkephath. stops are fricated after non-consonantals. Not just vowels: thus /j/ and /w/ count. Shared with Hebrew but likely due to imposition due to the arrival of likely Aramaic-speaking Babylonian and Persian Jewry in Israel in c. 538 BCE -- not shared with Punic/Phoenician I think? In any case this the last development shared with Hebrew, whether due to pre-divergence development or due to Aramaic influence upon Hebrew. 
[-son] > [+cont] / [-cons] __

$ /i/ and /u/ reduce to ə (probably /ɨ/ at first) in open syllables, medially and finally
[+syl,+hi] > ə / __ #
[+syl,+hi] > ə / __ [-syl] [+syl] 

$ /ɨ/ in a syllable after another /ə/ is deleted (case of kaːtibum > kaːθəβə > kaːθəβ)
ə > ∅ / ə ([+cons])* __

$ ə deleted between a buccal stop and a fricative 
ə > ∅ / [-cont,+cons] __ [+cont] 

$ surviving *ə final opens to a (house, olivier, death)
ə > a / __ # 


$ initial j- to ʔ i before a cons. 
j > ʔ i / # __ [+cons]

$ preference for final -a continues, causing final aw- to metathesize
a w > w a / __ # 


~Unknown-Stage

$After this point we will generate Eastern Neo-Aramaic from this unknown (probably Aramaic, as it now looks pretty different from Hebrew) stage. 

$ aj leveled to ɛ
a j > ɛ 

$r becomes a guttural, as I know is evidenced for Babylonian Hebrew and Babylonian Jewish Neo-Aramaic (an eastern Neo-Aramaic dialect??) (cf. Geoffrey Khan 1995, "The pronunciation of reš in the Tiberian Tradition of Biblical Hebrew", Hebrew Union College Annual, vol. 66 pp 67-80, www.jstor.org/stable/23508515). (admit this is justifiedǃ) 
r > ʀ

$Around now, Eastern Neo-Aramaic decides it hates non-strident spirants. 

$θ after a consonant becomes s 
θ > s / [+cons] __

$θ or s next to a guttural student becomes the emphatic sibilant sʶ. Gutturals hereː q, ʀ, ħ... not counting ʔ for now despite the Hebrew tradition as it lacks the feature [+back]. This rule can see through a posterior schwa.
[+ant,+cont] > sʶ / [+back,+cons,-hi] __
[+ant,+cont] > sʶ / __ (ə) [+back,+cons,-hi]

$Remaining θ debuccalized.
θ > h 

$β velarized and glided. 
β > w

$ħ velarized too. Must be after it triggers emphasis of s and former θ. 
ħ > x

$p aspirated. 
p > pʰ 

$vocalic length lost.
[+syl] > [-long]
